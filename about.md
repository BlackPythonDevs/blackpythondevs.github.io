## Mission

---

### Own your Masters: Support members while ensuring they control the message around

We're here to amplify your voice, not the other way around. That's why we're happy to share what you've done without without making it about us.

Any content that a member contributes to the community is given to them to publish as they please. That means if it's on our platforms, they allowed us to publish and have the right to change their mind at any time.

### Secure the Bag: Establish guidance, mentorship, and career support for _Black Python Devs_ Members

Lack of stable employment often prevents members from contributing to the greater community at their desired leve. It is important that Black Python Developers are first and foremost employed and compensated at a fair rate and given opportunities to thrive.

We want to ensure that the members range in different technical roles, skills, and skill levels so that we can address the widest variety of needs from the community.

### Extend Their Reach: Expand support from existing Python and Other Technology focused organizations to communities of _Black Python Devs_ members

We can't be everything to everyone. We also don't need to recreate all of the amazing programs designed for Pythonistas. Our goal is to support getting these existing programs to Black developers and fill in the gaps where they exists.

New programs and initiatives are often done with the help of those that have come before us, so that we can ensure the best opportunity for our members.

### Support the Ecosystem: Create opportunities to invest in the local communities that members of _Black Python Devs_ represent

Communities that are void of opportunities are often abandoned. While we can't move entire companies to these areas we can make sure that the local areas and businesses continue to thrive.

When we need to spend money, we look at where our members are and invest in their hometowns. This allows Black communities to shine beyond their point on the map.

## Why online first

---

We hope in the long run to create many in-person user groups and events, but we have to understand where we can make the largest impacts.

To do this we're hoping to gather folks from around the world and see where our largest audiences are.
