Wesley is passionate about racial justice, workplace equity, and neurodiversity.

### Interactive Talks

This is a summit focused on learning, and we learn by asking questions and connecting so we've asked three amazing speakers from inside Black Python Devs and outside of it to share knowledge with our leaders that can be taken back to their communities or used to make their efforts stronger.
