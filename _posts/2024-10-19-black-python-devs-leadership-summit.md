At 2:50 - 3:00 in the afternoon, we prepared to break out into sessions for an hour; these sessions were very informative and we recapped at 4:15 - 4:45 pm.

At 4:45 - 5:00 pm, we took a coffee break and grabbed snacks from the hall before going in for the Closing Remarks.

To wrap up the day, we had a fun, soft drinks session and water cooler conversations were had while we closed up the summit and went for dinner in the area.

## Key Discussions

There was a lot of conversation around succession planning and feelings of being overwhelmed, burnout, and not feeling that opportunities to help and receive help were being effectively handled. This starts at the top and the executor agrees that they need to be willing to put more trust in the team. They also showed interest in creating standardized methods for onboarding and offboarding new leaders.

There were also conversations about helping people get more involved in open source. A breakout session on physical health and wellness as well as conversations around fundraising opportunities for BPD.

## Logistics

Overall the event came in under budget at approximately $2000. The biggest with the generous donation of a venue by the Caktus group. This event was completely covered by the We also raised an additional $200 in donations for BPD. We had about 25 in attendance in person with another 20 consistently online. One highlight was that we had a couple of folks from the local community find out about the event and join us. There was a lot of conversation about the Raleigh-Durham area being a potential site for a local Black Python Devs User Group.

There is currently a plan for at least one other independent leadership summit to be held in Africa (location not yet announced) in the Fall of 2025 and a possible leadership summit to be held at PyCon US 2025 as a track. If we can standardize cost and logistics, we can see these leadership summits as a regional track that can benefit more local communities.
