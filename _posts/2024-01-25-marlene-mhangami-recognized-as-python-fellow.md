Every quarter, the Python Software Foundation recognizes individuals in the community for their exceptional contributions to the Python community. Black Python Devs member [Marlene Mangami](http://marlenemhangami.com/) was selected as a fellow for [Q3 2023](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/01/announcing-python-software-foundation.html).

The post highlights that Marlene and other winners are recognized for being "phenomenal leaders," as well as for fostering and maintaining libraries and communities.

Marlene has been heavily involved in the Python community, having served as a PSF Chair and a member of the DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) Working Group. She has also played a pivotal role in launching many events across Africa.

Congratulations, Marlene, on being recognized for your hard work! We're excited to see what you have in store for the Python community at large, and for Black Python developers in the future.
