# The Black Python Devs Open Source Program

The Black Python Devs Open Source Contribution Program is a 2-month running initiative designed to empower Black Python developers by providing them with the skills, mentorship, and opportunities to contribute to open-source projects. This program focuses on fostering diversity and inclusion within the tech community, ensuring that talented developers from underrepresented backgrounds have the platform to showcase their abilities and make meaningful contributions to the open-source ecosystem.

Participants will work on issues from repositories around Black Python Devs as well as partnered community gaining hands-on experience in real-world projects. The program includes a structured onboarding process, technical and soft skills workshops, regular mentorship, and a final showcase event where participants present their progress.

By the end of the program, participants will have enhanced their technical skills, expanded their professional network, and made tangible contributions to the open-source community.
